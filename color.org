* Science
+ Red has the longest wavelength.  Fastest. Warmest
+ Violet has the shortest.  Slowest

* The Colors - The 12 Hues
+ Primary – Yellow, Red, Blue - Basic colors can't be made from other colors.  All other colors are derived from these 3 colors. 
+ Secondary – Orange, Violet, Green - Created by mixing the primary colors. 
+ Tertiary – Yellow-orange, Red-orange, Red-violet, Blue-violet, Blue-green, Yellow-green - made from a primary and secondary. 

* Johannes Itten’s Color Wheel

Color can be broken down into two very broad categories: cool and
warm. Warm colors such as red, orange, and yellow are active. Cool
colors such as blue, green, and violet are chill. These are roughly
split down the middle of the color wheel.

Here’s a key fact to remember about this divide. Warm colors will
always win a hierarchy battle between the two. Think about it like a
landscape. The cool blue sky recedes into the background as the
earthy, warm landscape comes forward.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ROYGBIV - Primary colors or hue - rainbow hues
  Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo , Violet

Tint - add white to tint
Shade - add black to hue
Saturation - vividness of hue. From dull to pure

Color "Rules"
- Three colors are all you need in design
- A good rule of thumb is to begin your design using just black and white. 

My philosophy is to have two colors do the heavy lifting and reserve a third in a sidekick role

* Adding Black

The first very safe approach to colour is to add and subtract black.

* Analogous colours


* Light and Dark

In fine art, composition dictates in very simplified terms that dark colours appear at the front and light at the back.
